# Exercise Generator - Details
This is a simple exercise generator that was created using API-Ninja's <b>Exercise API</b>. You can enter any sort of muscle group and the script will spit out multiple different exercises with details including:

Live Demo: **[https://react-dp6ej4.stackblitz.io/]**

- Name of the Exercise
- Type of exercise (Strength, Cardio)
- Targetted Muscle Group/Groups
- Equipment required for the exercise
- Exercise difficulty
- Instructions to do the exercise

I have worked with APIs before, but this project was a challenge since it was completely coded in **ReactJS**. I really had no exposure to React prior to this project, so I learned a lot building this application. Some major concepts I learned is:
- JSX and the different rules for it
- React Components (Importing, exporting)
- Making Reusable Components
- Populating components from an array of data
- JS Functions like **.map()** and **.reduce()** and **.filter()**
- Callback functions
- React Props
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Case Statements/Ternary Operators

Overall, the project to me was a great experience as I was able to learn React. After using vanilla JS for so long, moving onto something powerful and flexible like React is really interesting and once again got me motivated to learn web dev!

# How to Use
The way this application works is very simple. On loading of the page. you'll be met with a screen like this:

<br>

Then, you'll go ahead and put in some muscle group. For this demonstration, I chose to put in "<i>Glutes</i>". Go ahead and click "<b>Search</b>" and you'll see the exercise results pop up like this:

<br>

If you type in a muscle group that is not registered with the API or type something in wrong, you'll see something like this:

<br>
And that's all! It's a pretty simple project, but one that has taught me a lot. I'm open to any suggestions/any comments on my coding (not the best lol).
