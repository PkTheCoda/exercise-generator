# Exercise Generator - Details
This is a simple exercise generator that was created using API-Ninja's <b>Exercise API</b>. You can enter any sort of muscle group and the script will spit out multiple different exercises with details including:

- Name of the Exercise
- Type of exercise (Strength, Cardio)
- Targetted Muscle Gr

If you type in a muscle group that is not registered with the API or type something in wrong, you'll see something like this:
